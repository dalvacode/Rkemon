# Rkémon

This repository aims to collect, organize and analyze pokémon data.

Source of the data can be found in the <a title="Sources" href="https://github.com/dalvacode/pkmr/blob/main/data/sources.txt">sources.txt file</a>.


## How to use this repository:
- Easiest: check the main results at the <a title="Outputs" href="https://github.com/dalvacode/pkmr/tree/main/out">out folder</a>.
- Advanced: use the data files (and even scripts) to perform your own analyses, but only if you 


## Analyses:
- Describe generations: number of pokémons, evolution lines, 2 vs 3-stage lines, and special pokémons
- What are the most and least frequent types and type-combinations? (overall and by generation)
- Explore egg types and sex rates
- Explore strings (names, categories)


## To-do:
- Improve README file
- Include my personal list of favourite pokémons
